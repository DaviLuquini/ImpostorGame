- Use comments only when really needed
- Try to always use existents components
- Try to always use Angular Signals
- Not forget to always use @if, @else, @for
- **Frontend-only:** No backend, no API, no multiplayer, no authentication
- Not create any TEST files
- Standalone is true by default, you don't need to specify it in every component
